                <ul>
                    <li>License Header: Always add the current ASF license header as described in <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html">ASF Source Header</a>.</li>
                    <li>Trailing Whitespaces: Remove all trailing whitespaces. Eclipse users can use Source-&gt;Cleanup option to accomplish this.</li>
                    <li>Indentation: Use 4 space indents and never use tabs!</li>
                    <li>Line wrapping: Use 120-column line width for Java code and Javadoc.</li>
                    <li>Author Tags: Do not use Author Tags. The code is developed and owned by the community. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Eclipse Configuration Tips</h4>
                <h5>Configure Eclipse Preferences</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download Eclipse Formatting and Style Guides for <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/airavata/attic/svn-to-git-archive/etc/eclipse/">Airavata Style Templates</a></li>
                    <li>To add Formatter: Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Code Style &gt;  Formatter and import the airavata-formatting-preferences.xml downloaded in the previous step. </li>
                    <li>To add Templates: Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Code Style &gt; Code Templates and import the airavata-code-style-template.xml. This templates adds the ASF header and so on for new code. </li>

                recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included
                on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
