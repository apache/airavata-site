                <p>Apache Airavata originated from the Extreme Computing Lab at Indiana University then directed by Dr.
                    Dennis Gannon. The concepts and initial versions of the code is a byproduct of over a dozen PhD
                    dissertations and years of research and development efforts. The software is initially envisioned to
                    meet the challenging goals of the [Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) project.</p>

                <p>LEAD has pioneered new approaches for integrating, modeling, and mining complex weather data and
                    Cyberinfrastructure systems to enable faster-than-real-time severe weather forecasts. LEAD goals
                    required to create a dynamically adaptive, on-demand, grid-enabled workflow system supporting long
                    running applications and on-demand computing. LEAD has subsequently produced close to 450 research
                    publications combined in all disciplines. The resulting software framework was built on the concepts
                    of service oriented architectures powering the LEAD Gateway Portal.</p>

                <h2 class="theme-h2-sub-header">Open Gateway Computing Environments</h2>
                <p>The Open Gateway Computing Environments (OGCE) adopted the LEAD workflow suite generalized, enhanced,
                    tested and maintained the software evolving into the OGCE workflow suite. OGCE has promoted
                    collaborative software development through SourceForge and has worked together with various
                    universities and Lanka Software Foundation in enriching and sustaining the software.</p>

                <p>The Science Gateways Program within TeraGrid Grid Infrastructure Group and its follow on Extreme
                    Science and Engineering Discovery Environment(XSEDE) has significantly contributed to the enrichment
                    and wider adoption of the legacy versions of the Airavata software. These extensive usage by various
                    science gateways has matured the software and building in fault tolerant capabilities.</p>
